# My Self-taught Journey to be a Developer
*"Making a difference" is always my motto. It reminds me to enhance myself and keep moving forwards. I am seeking my own way to make a difference to the community, the society. Software development enables me the unlimited possibilities to contribute in many different ways. I created this project to record all the resources which helped me in the journey to be a developer who makes a difference.*

  
## Books
*I love books. It is always the entry door for me every time I need to get into a new topic. Books always have their structures and proved content to a specified knowledge that you can rely on.*

- [The Quick Python Book]

	- My first programming language book. It amazed me the philosophy of the python language. Beautiful is better than ugly, Simple is better than complex, and Readability counts. This book gave me a structure guideline to revise many essential components of programming I forgot many years, like data types, flow control and functions. And, from basic to advanced topics, guided through me the whole learning journey of python. I created a few repositories to record some little programs I wrote after the learning.

		- [A Word Count Tool]

		- [A roman to Decimal Converter]

		- [A Paper Scissors Rock game] for my son to try, have fun!

		- [My first ever calculator]

- [Eloquent JavaScript]

	- This book is my favorite. The author uploaded the entire book online (for free) with realtime sandbox for every code example, reader can try their understanding by amending the codes and get realtime result. He did make a difference to the world to help the beginners like me on their journey to be a developer. I expressed my deeply thanks for his contribution. JavaScript is the second language I learnt. (It does not include the C language I just know a bit long time ago.) I can say JavaScript is a flexible and adaptable language with many different ways of syntax and easy to learn (at the beginning at least). Some chapters in the book are quite difficult to understand like the crows tech example to explain asynchronous programming. Some chapters are pretty advanced, such as the "mario" like game ([a platform game]) can be wrote entirely just using JavaScript and a browser to play, nothing else needed to install or etc. I created a [answerToEloquent repository] to record my own version of answer to many exercises/projects in the book.

- [The Road to React]

	- This one is still in the process as I shifted to implement real React projects, by following the Youtube videos I mentioned below.

- [ng-book] The Complete Book on Angular

	- I treat this as my first reference for Angular, and it is still in the process. I created a repository for my first angular reddit-like app.

		- [angular-reddit]


## Youtube
*No matter how many materials you have read, the ultimate goal is you absorbed those knowledge and applied them to the real world applications.*

- [Corey Schafer Channel]

	- His youtube videos are very clear and easy to follow. I learnt the way he wrote codes and how to use the IDE in a smart way. I wrote my first comprehensive web application using django. It is a blog app. And, I added some other functions like commenting and a todo list. The web application is still live for my own family use. Of course, I created a [Djangoblog repository] with all my source codes.
- [JavaScript Mastery]
	- Their content is very updated. You can find many useful videos using the latest tech stacks. I practised React by following their videos, learned how to pass Props, use different Hooks and CircularProgress. I got better understanding of APIs by using it like the geolocation google maps API through implementing the [Travel Advisor app] and creating my own one like the little [Amazon Scraper] program.


## Coding Challenge Sites
*Resources to help you prepare technical coding challenges or interviews*

- [HackerRank]
	- You are not only doing code challenges, but also other technical skills equipped you for your next developer job like databases and its SQL queries. A [hackerRank repository] was created to store my own codes.
- [codewars]
	- Every time you solved the provided challenge, you can review some other codes wrote by other developers. I got inspired by some innovative approaches or extremely short codes and learnt the best practice to solve the same problem. A [codewars repository] was created as well.


## Courses
*Certification from well-known educational provider is a recognition to me from a third party to acknowledge my practical skills for development.*

- [Harvard CS50W]
	- This is a practical Web Programming course which required prior experience in programming language. It picks up where CS50X (Harvard well-known Computer Science introduction course) leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. It required the full completion of all their six projects to get the Certificate. Because of academic honesty, I cannot upload my own codes to the public. I am currently doing its fifth project and will reach the final one very soon.
  
  
## Official Documentations
*They are my primary support sites all the time. I cannot remember how many hours I read through their content. They are concise for quick remind and detailed for full understanding.
